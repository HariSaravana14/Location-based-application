🔑 Key Features:

User Authentication: Secure login and signup pages to ensure data privacy.
CRUD Operations: Seamlessly create, read, update, and delete location data.
Interactive Map: A dynamic map interface to visualize and interact with location data.
💻 Tech Stack:

Backend: Express.js
This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into full-stack development and enhance my skills in building responsive, user-friendly applications. I leveraged React.js for creating a robust and dynamic user interface, and Express.js for a powerful and efficient backend API.

I’m incredibly proud of the results and am excited to apply these skills to future projects. A huge thank you to everyone who supported me throughout this journey!

Looking forward to new challenges and opportunities in the tech world! 🚀
